// NOTE:  THE FOLLOWING VALUES ARE THE PASSWORD USED TO ENABLE
// REMOTE ACCESS.
//
// The have the following properties and requirements:
// a. Must not be an existing impulse
// b. Must be entered in the specified order
// c. Must be in the range 1 to 255 excluding previously used impulses
//
// They must be entered in the correct order which gives 256*256*256 or
// 16777216 possible passwords.  If a specified order wasn't given, it
// would only be 768 possibilities.
//
// BY DEFAULT, REMOTE ADMIN ACCESS IS DISABLED // NOTE NOT FOR CTFBOT
// This is done by setting the admin passwords all to -1.
//
// If you wanted to enable it, pick three random numbers (that aren't
// existing impulses) and put 'em here, for example:
//
//		float	ADMIN_PWD_1	= 179;
//		float	ADMIN_PWD_2	= 131;
//		float	ADMIN_PWD_3	= 157;
//
// which would give you a password of 179, 131 and 157.  To send this from
// a Quake client, do a bind like this:
//
// bind p "impulse 179;wait;impulse 131;wait;impulse 157"
//
// When you hit p, you'll be granted remote admin functionality.
//
// Currently the only admin functions available right now are kick
// team change, and level change.  They are bound to impulse 151, 
// impulse 152 and impuluse 153 respectively.
//
// The way it works is after you enter the admin password, do an
// impulse 151/152/153.  You'll get a list of players on the server with their
// numbers.  Send the next impulse with the number of the player
// to act the command on.

// CHANGE THE FOLLOWING THREE -1 NUMBERS TO YOUR ADMIN PASSWD
//float	ADMIN_PWD_1	= -1;  // change me to first number of the passwd
//float	ADMIN_PWD_2	= -1;  // change me to second number of the passwd
//float	ADMIN_PWD_3	= -1;  // change me to third number of the passwd

//TONY
//BOT ADMIN
//THIS IS AN EXTREMELY LIGHT VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL
//ADMINS do not have to option of kicking or changing levels, etc.
//they just have access to the cool impulses.

//THE ADMIN_PWD NUMBERS ARE GENERATED BY THE COORDINATOR
