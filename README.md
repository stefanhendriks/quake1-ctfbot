# quake1-ctfbot
Copy of [ctf bot and CTF game code (Threewave) and bot code](https://www.moddb.com/mods/threewave-capture)

# Compiling
This is QuakeC, a compiler (QCC) is also in this repo, it is very old (as it was taken from the original ZIP file).

There is also a mac compatible QCC (frikqcc) compiler, which I tested on Sierra and worked fine. This was built from [this source code](https://github.com/heinekev/lion_frikqcc27)

If you want to generate a `progs.dat` and use that for your CTF pleasures, just run the compiler at the dir and it should generate one in the same folder.

# Editing

If you use IntelliJ IDEA (like me) often, you might want to load this project with that and use
[this quakec plugin for IDEA](https://github.com/TimePath/idea-quakec/releases)

You need to install it from disk, works like a charm.
