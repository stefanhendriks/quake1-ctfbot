This is a binary of ctfbot12 I had.

Additionally I recompiled it with some more waypoints (ie, for e1m1, etc, not only ctfx maps).

It was a bit clunky, but I realised I wanted to preserve it and wanted to keep
the source somewhere at github for preservation.

In case you just want to play this, just unzip this in your quake folder and 
run Quake with `-game <dirname>` where `<dirname>` is the name of the unpacked folder.
