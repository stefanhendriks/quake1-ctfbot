<h2><a name="QC-QUIRK">10.1 The quirks of Quake and Quake-C</a></h2> 

<p>Here are some characteristics of Quake-C that you had better be aware of.
</p>

<h4>The names of variable and functions must be unique</h4>  

<p> The names of functions, variables and fields must be unique.
  For instance, you cannot define a variable with the same name as a field.
  However, local variables can be defined more than once (they had better!).
</p>

<h4>Composition of function is not supported</h4>

<p>Since all the functions use a single parameter marshaling 
area, and a single <b>global</b> variable to store their reture result, 
you should <b>NEVER</b> try to call a function within another function call.</p>
<p>Example: printing the coordinate of entity <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-glob.htm#self" target="content">self</a>
</p><pre>    sprintf(self, <b>vtos( self.origin )</b>);
</pre>
will fail miserably (sending the message somewhere in hell), so
it should be replaced by:
<pre>    <b>text</b> = vtos( self.origin );
    sprintf(self, <b>text</b>);
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this also applies to operators:
</p><pre>   sum = anglestovec( 45) + anglestovec( 90);
</pre>
will fail an should be replaced by:
<pre>   <b>sum</b> = anglestovec( 45);
   sum = <b>sum</b> + anglestovec( 90);
</pre>
<p></p>

<p>Actually, Quake-C is rather lame as a compiler, and you will probably
make hundred of little mistakes like that, that the compiler will not warn
you of. But remember Quake-C was built for "performance", not ease of use.
And also that it wasn't designed by people from the MIT.
Remember also that you got it for <b>free</b>... you can always
get <b>gcc</b> (the Gnu C Compiler) for the same price ;-)
</p>

<h4>You cannot initialise variable with default values.</h4>

<p>If you give a default value to a quake-C variable, this variable
will be considered as a constant. And since the value of constants is not
supposed to change, your program may not work properly after that.
</p>

<h4>Coordinates are relative to the world.</h4>

<p>  All the geometry (coordinate positions, directions, angles) are relative to the
  world. They are never relative to a given object. To know the direction
  an object is facing, you have to require calculation of the <b>v_front</b>
  vector (respectively <b>v_right</b> and <b>v_up</b> for the right, and the top).
</p>

<h2><a name="QC-FAQ">10.2 Frequently Asked Questions about Quake-C</a></h2>

<h3>How do I change the viewpoint?</h3>

<p>You would like that a given player sees through the eyes of another
entity. This commonly happens at the end of the level (all players see
through a camera), or when the player head is severed (gibbed), or when
a player is invisible (he only exists as his eyes).</p>

<p>But the example above work by changing the player entity, and what
you want is probably just to see through a camera (Duke3D) or a missile
(Descent).</p>

<p>This operation is known in the Quake network protocol as a setview message. 
But nowhere it's defined in Quake-C, and there's no function to change the 
view port. So the solution is to encode a <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-net.htm#msg_setviewport" target="content">
set view port </a> message, followed by a <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-net.htm#msg_setviewangles" target="content">
set view angles</a> message (to take the orientation of the camera).
</p>
<p>This works fine, but if the entity you use as a camera was not declared to
the client, then the view port will be set to <b>'0 0 0'</b>, which is usually 
omewhere in the void. Hence the need to send an explicit update message.
</p>
<p>Also, the view might <b>not be updated correctly</b>, if the camera is not in the
same area as the player (same potential visibility set, to be exact). That's
because the Quake server only sends updates to entities that are visible to
the player.
</p>


<h3>How do I teleport a player into another server</h3>

<p><i>A trick by <a href="http://www.ecis.com/~tiger">Steven Lang</a> (tiger@ecis.com)</i></p>

<p></p><pre>    // In the slipgate touch function
    // other = entity that touched
    if(other.classname == "player")
      stuffcmd(other, "connect <i>server</i>.<i>address</i>\n");  // send command
</pre>  
 When the slipgate is touched, the entity jumps to another server.<p></p>

<p>Trouble: the player stats and weapons won't be preserved, and the
player would be dumped to the console if the other server was full
or not available.<br>
That's why John Carmack, will rewrite the code of Quake.exe to implement his
<b>Quake World</b> proposal, and advanced server with all kinds of goodies... 
permission lists, ability to block an IP, etc. (info from quake-c list).</p>


<h3>How do I manipulate strings in Quake-C?</h3>

<p>Well, you can have any kind of strings, so long as they can't be changed.
<i>"In Ford we trust"</i> (Brave New World).
</p><p>The Quake compiler only defines operations <b>=</b>, <b>==</b>, <b>!=</b> on strings.
No concatenation is possible.
</p>

<h3>How to read string variables, or text messages?</h3>

<p>Well, if you know, tell, that would make a nice addition to this specs.</p>

<h3>How do I move an entity in Quake-C?</h3>

<p>You have better not touch it's position, else some stuff in the C code
might not be valid anymore. So you call the <b>setposition()</b> 
built-in function.

</p><h3>How to change the velocity of an entity (make it bounce off walls)?</h3>

<p><i>Information by Greg Lewis.</i></p>

<p>It seems that an entity's velocity can't be changed in the Touch function 
of the entity. Making the calculations there will be of no use.<br>
So just set <b>entity.movetype</b> to MOVETYPE_BOUNCE, <b>entity.nextthink</b>
to 0.1 (to let it bounce off), and set <b>entity.think</b> to the name of
a function that, when called 0.1 second later, will set <b>entity.velocity</b>
to the right direction.
</p>

<h3>How to calculate the direction a player is facing?</h3>

<p>Assuming the player is <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-glob.htm#self" target="content">, the entity field 
self.</a><a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-enty.htm#dot_angles" target="content">angles</a> contains the orientation angles
of the player (as set by moving the mouse).
</p>
<p>Then the function <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#makevectors" target="content">makeverctors</a>( self.angles)
will calculate three vectors, that point in the direction the
player is <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#v_forward" target="content">facing</a>, but also to the 
<a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#v_right" target="content">right</a> of the player (strafing direction)
and to the direction the player is <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#v_up" target="content">standing</a>. 
</p>
<p> Note that those vectors are normalised to 1, so if you want to
know what lays 100 units in front of the player, use
<tt>self.<a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-enty.htm#dot_origin" target="content">origin</a> + 100 * <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#v_forward" target="content">facing</a></tt>.
</p>

<h3>How to send a message to a player when he logs in?</h3>

<p>It has been noticed that using a <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#sprint" target="content">sprint</a>()
in function <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/client.htm#ClientConnect">ClientConnect</a>
just plain doesn't send any message at all. Maybe the client is
not ready to receive messages at this point.
</p>
<p>However, Doug Keenan (doug.keegan@tamu.edu) has reported he could
send such a text message by putting the <a href="http://www.gamers.org/dEngine/quake/spec/quake-spec34/qc-built.htm#sprint" target="content">sprint</a>()
close to the begining of the ClientConnect function. It doesn't
work at the end, apparently.
</p>


<h3>How to...?</h3>

<p>Another unanswered question? Just ask on the quake-c mailing list.</p>



<hr>
<h2><a name="QC-SUGG">10.3 Writing clean Quake-C code</a></h2>

<p>Here are some <b>suggestions</b> that you should really consider
when writing Quake-C code. Well, there are no obligations, but that
would make life simpler for others when they read your code (and thus
for you when you read theirs).</p>

<p>I assume here that you want to develop code that others can re-use,
or that can be mixed seamlessly with codes written by others.</p>
<small>(If you are reinventing the whole world all by yourself, you hardly 
need any help or counsels. By the way, the first command is <b>+light</b>).
</small>

<ol>
<li> Please <b>put comments in your code</b>.<br>
  <small>Of course, the real gurus don't need comments. They understand raw
  Quake-C, even compiled. They can even imagine all the parts of your code
  before they read them. Even before you write them. But actually, they seldom
  read your code. Only normal people do.</small>
</li><li> Please tag the <b>begining</b> and <b>end</b> of your modifications,
  if you are fixing a code from someone else.<br>
  Also put a date, and put a reason for the fix. Example:<br>
  <pre>       <i>// Patch by Nezu The Unworthy  8/3/96</i> 
       <i>// Gimme a chance to win a deathmatch</i>
       if(self.name != "nezu")
         self.frag = self.frag - 10;
       <i>// Patch End</i>
  </pre>
</li><li> Each time you create a new function, a new variable or a new field, 
     please give it a <b>name that will not conflict</b> with function or
     variable defined by others.<br>
     A rather sure way to do this is to prefix every name with some
     abvreviated module name, or you initials, or whatever rare
     combination of three or four letter. Example:
     <pre>     void() NTU_think =  // Nezu The Unworthy starts thinking
     {
        self.skin = 1;   // turn red and boil
     };
     </pre>
</li><li> Each time you implement some set of related functions, you should
     <b>create a new Quake-C module</b>, and give it a name different
     from the existing ones.<br>
     Please do not use one of the module names used by id software, this 
     would be confusing. Try to be original, else we might end-up with 
     two hundred modules called <i>impulse.qc</i>.
</li><li> When you want to distribute some modified Quake-C programs:
     <ul>
     <li> include a <b>file_id.diz</b> file explaining in 5 lines what
          your patch does, and where it should be stored in the archives
          (this file is to be read by system administrators)
     </li><li> include a <b>readme.txt</b> file explaining in details what your 
          patch does, how it does it, and what common files you had to modify.
     </li><li> include the <b>.qc</b> modules that you created from scratch.
     </li><li> For the modules you modified, please let them pass through the
          utilities <b>diff</b> (see below), so that the original file can be 
          patched the utility <b>patch</b>.
          even if it has been modified since.
     </li><li> Do not distribute modified <b>.qc</b> modules. Future versions of
          Quake will contain different code, and all your work would then be lost.
     </li></ul>     
</li><li> You should compile and distribute a version of your code, as a single
     <b>PROGS.DAT</b> file, to be used by those who just wanna have fun.
     Don't forget them, they largely overnumber the people who directly deal 
     with Quake-C.
</li><li> Upload your Quake-C patches to the primary quake ftp site at 
     <a href="ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/idgames2/incoming">ftp.cdrom.com</a>.<br>
     Maybe if it's good enough it will also appear in the
     <a href="http://mfh.acaf.uab.edu/allen/">Quake-C code repository</a>.
</li></ol>


<h3>Using Diff and Patch</h3>

<p><i>Information by Jeff Epler (jepler@cse.unl.edu)</i></p>

<p> You can find a DOS version of 
<a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet/gnu/v2gnu/dif271b.zip">diff</a>
and <a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet/gnu/v2gnu/pat21b.zip">patch</a>
on all the major ftp archives, for instance <b>Simtelnet</b> (mirrored at
<a href="ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet">ftp://oak.oakland.edu/pub/simtelnet</a>).
</p>

<p> For a Win32 (windows95 and NT) version, see
<a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/win32/i386/diffutils.zip">diffutils.zip</a>
and <a href="ftp://ftp.cygnus.com/pub/gnu-win32/win32/i386/patch.zip">patch.zip</a>.
</p>

<p>The full documentation for diff and patch is available on 
<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/!info/diff.info/!!first">www.ai.mit.edu</a>,
but here are some shortened instructions:
</p><pre>To make a diff:
. start with yourdir/ with an entire working set of .qc files, and v101qc/
with the virgin qc files from id.
. diff -ur --new-file v101qc yourdir &gt; patchfil

To patch with a diff:
. copy everything in v101qc (or yourdir if you want to add these patches to
your already-customized setup) to newdir
. change to newdir
. patch -p1 &lt; patchfil
. Look for any "rejected" patches and apply them by hand using your
favorite 2-window text editor.  These should be few or none if the author
kept his changes well-structured or you patched from exactly the same
source he diffed from.
